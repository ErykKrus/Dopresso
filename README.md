There are a few key areas that need improvement in order to make Psilocybin a more viable depression treatment.  
Consider contributing your time and effort to the software, hardware and/or research!

Areas Of Focus:  
• Reduction of Cost Per Gram.  
• Increased Ease of Effective Intake Planning.  
• Legalisation. 

I believe these are all intertwined; helping one helps the others speed up development as more research and interest will develop.  
My primary focus for 2023 will be to create an Effective Intake Planner and begin work on cost reduction. Visit the folders for more!
