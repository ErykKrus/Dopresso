There are a few key areas that need improvement in order to make Psilocybin a more viable depression treatment.  
Consider contributing your time and effort to the software, hardware and/or research!

Areas Of Focus:  
• Reduction of Cost Per Gram.  
• Increased Ease of Effective Intake Planning.  
• Legalisation. 

I believe these are all intertwined; helping one raises interest in the field, thus helping the others.  
My primary focus for 2023 will be to create an Effective Intake Planner and begin work on cost reduction.
