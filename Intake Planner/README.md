## Intake Planner

Currently, calculating dosages and generating intake schedules requires using tools based on authers "experience" and reading forums.  
To make consistent Psilocybin intake an easier, safer, and "accurate" experience, a research-backed approach has to be implemented.

As always, feel free to contribute! Ideas, work, research, programming, or whatever - all welcome :)

Notables:  
• The Jupyter Notebook format was chosen because both research and code can be easily contained in one document.     
• Python was selected as, in my experience, it is one of the easiest languages to learn and understand. Also Pandas is great with data.

To-Do:  
• Build dosage calculator that displays long-term intake schedule (1 Month - 1 Year).  
• Account for tolerance build up over provided periods.  
• Implement breaks of 14 days inbetween intake "groups".  
• Incorporate option to include intra-breaks within each intake "group".  
• Implement option to specify length of intra-breaks.  
• Display associated costs.  
• Display tolerance vs time graph (inverse shark fins).  

Done:  
• Build basic development prototype.
